# Dino Travel

## About

For DePaul's 2022 Winter Quarter capstone (CSC394/IS396), we were tasked with creating a full stack CRUD application.

Over the course of 2 months, we created a flight booking system. We used the [Amadeus API](https://developers.amadeus.com/) to get live flight data and locations. Users are able to login through a Google account and can create a one-way, round-trip, or multi-city flight booking. Once the booking is completed, users can cancel their flights or update a reservation's information.

### Note

[Frontend](https://github.com/DPUPurpleDinos/DinoTravelFrontend) and [backend](https://github.com/DPUPurpleDinos/dino-travel) development was done through two separate repositories. The purpose of this repository is to share the source code and booklet in a single place.
